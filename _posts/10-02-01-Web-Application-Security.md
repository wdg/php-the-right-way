## Web Application Security {#web_application_security_title}

There are bad people ready and willing to exploit your web application. It is important that you take necessary
precautions to harden your web application's security. Luckily, the fine folks at
[The Open Web Application Security Project][1] (OWASP) have compiled a comprehensive list of known security issues and
methods to protect yourself against them. This is a must read for the security-conscious developer. [Survive The Deep End: PHP Security][3] by Padraic Brady is also another good web application security guide for PHP.
